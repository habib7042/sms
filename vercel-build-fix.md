# Vercel Build Fix

This file was created to trigger a fresh build on Vercel and ensure the latest commits with Prisma fixes are used.

## Changes Made:
1. Updated package.json build script to include `prisma generate && next build`
2. Added vercel.json configuration with PRISMA_GENERATE_SKIP_CACHE
3. Added PostgreSQL database management scripts
4. Added project description to package.json

## Expected Result:
- Vercel should build successfully with Prisma client generation
- All API routes should work properly
- The application should deploy without errors

## Build Status:
- âœ… Local build: Works
- âœ… GitHub commits: Up to date
- ðŸ”„ Vercel build: Pending update
